Overview
========
  The design of sumpis grew out of a necessity to automatically
  process the large number of data files collected with the 
  Seabird CTD packages deployed on the ORCA mooring packages.
  At the time the Seabird data conversion software ran only in 
  a Windows operating system.  As the ORCA project server is a 
  Linux based system, we initially used a Windows emulator on 
  the server to run the software, but quickly found this to be 
  cumbersome and vulnerable to potential hang ups.
  Our solution was to write a processing software package in Perl
  that uses all the Seabird equations (published in the sensor
  manuals, calibration sheets, and application notes) and 
  calibrations, while minimizing the number of configuration files
  necessary for processing.  

Installation
============
  Dependencies:
  	Perl version: 5.8 or higher. 
             
  Unpack the distribution and place it in your path.  Test by
  running:

      make test


Manual Operations
=================

  The SUMPIS program is used to process files collected with
  a Seabird CTD.  The current version supports the following 
  CTDS:
	19
	19Plus
	19Plus_v2
  Auxiliary Sensors:
	Oxygen:
		SBE 43 
	Flurometers:
		WetLABS WetStar 
		WetLABS FLNTUS	
	Nutrients:
		SatLantic ISUS

  Sumpis may be run through the command line or packaged in 
  a shell script.  It is used to process a directory of raw HEX files.

  Here is a list of the current command line options:
	-no-align: do not automatically align auxiliary sensors 
	-format: choose the file format to print out 
	-caldir: where the raw files can be found
	
	example command line:
	./sumpis.pl -no_align -format 19Plus_compare -caldir raw -config ../configurationFiles/TORCA_conf.txt raw/201601


File Descriptions
=================
  Raw files: Raw data files output from the Seabird CTD in HEX
	- must include header obtained by running the "DS" 
          command (display status)
	  followed by the "DH" command (display header) 
 	  followed by the "DC" command (display casts)

  (Latitude is necessary as it is used to calculate depth in meters) and 
  location of the necessary config and deployment files

  O2 bottle volume data: file that stores bottle volumes of 
  winkler sample bottles for use in calculating discrete samples.
  The current version of the code does not use discrete samples 
  to calibrate the sensor data.

  output column order: not currently used


Known Issues
============

	- alignment algorithm cannot shift by frations of a scan 
          as is done in the Seabird software package.
